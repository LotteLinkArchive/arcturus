		<h2>Donate</h2>
		<p>
			So, you're thinking about donating. That's really nice of you, honestly, and I don't think I can
			thank you enough if you actually follow through with such a thing. I realise donating to
			strangers on the internet is a pretty daunting thing, but I do rely on donations to help
			maintenance all of the hardware (and living conditions) that I need to write code and host, you
			know, sites like this.
		</p>
		<p>
			There's honestly very little I can give back to you, but here's a selection of things I'd be
			willing to do:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>List your name here, on this page</li>
			<li>
				Negotiate some kind of service (e.g maybe you want to ask me to a host a server for you
				before you donate?) - In which case, <a href="contact.php">contact me</a> beforehand
				please.
			</li>
			<li>
				Add an advertisement somewhere on this site (or elsewhere) assuming what you're
				advertising is actually good. Again, contact me beforehand for this.
			</li>
			<li>
				Negotiate a different payment method with you if none of the ones listed here are useful
				to you.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Payment Methods</h3>
		<p>
			Sorry for the limited selection of public payment methods. It's just really difficult to protect
			your real-world identity with the majority of payment methods out there nowadays.
			Cryptocurrencies are really the only way to do something like that reasonably well.
		</p>
