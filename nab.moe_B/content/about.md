hi, i'm nabla, the girl who does stupid things on the interwebs!

there isn't much to say about me - i like writing assembly code, C, Python- virtually anything that looks cool, really. i like playing with server computers and stuff. i say the word "gaming" a lot at random and it's pretty annoying - oh, and i do actually play games. i guess the only thing left to say is that [Nyanners is my spirit animal](https://tube.cadence.moe/channel/UCO5Jvsc_sKuZi3MhnJxrlzQ).

PS: you can email me at [contact@nab.moe](mailto:contact@nab.moe)
