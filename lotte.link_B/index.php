		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
			Hi. I'm Nabla.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm really bad at describing myself - so bear with me here. Put simply, I like
			computers, and I write funky code (primarily in C, now at least). You may find some of it a
			little interesting. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I strongly encourage people to use free (as in freedom) and open source software as opposed to
			proprietary garbageware. I like complaining about proprietary software a lot. Especially
			Windows. Please don't use Windows. Anything is better than Windows. I'd even be happier if you
			used ReactOS instead. Just.. just stop using Windows.
		</p>
		<p>
			You'll probably find a lot of my rants on this website; I think those explain how I feel about
			things far better than this page ever could, assuming I ever get around to writing them.
