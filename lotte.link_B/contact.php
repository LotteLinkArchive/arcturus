		<h3>Contact Policy</h3>
		<p>
			Here are some general guidelines for contacting me:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				If you are a spambot, please automatically send your spam mail to
				<a href="mailto:chernobyl@lotte.link">chernobyl@lotte.link</a> so that I can
				automatically filter out any further emails from your address.
			</li>
			<li>
				Please make it obvious what you're contacting me for in your subject line. If you're not
				using email, this should be somewhere in your first message.
			</li>
			<li>
				I would appreciate it if you could give me a well-formed PGP public key so that I may
				reply (particularly in the case of email)
			</li>
			<li>
				If you're trying to get me to buy something, don't. I don't care. I don't have any
				money.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you're looking to pay me as some sort of sponsorship or you're trying to pay for
				advertisements, be aware that you'll need to give me time to verify that your product
				isn't garbage. I will not advertise something that I cannot try for myself. It better
				be something really good.
			</li>
		</ul>
