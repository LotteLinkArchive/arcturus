		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
			Hi. I'm Naphtha. That's obviously not my real name, because I don't like telling the entire
			internet my real name. If you want a pseudonym, go with "Naphtha Nepanthez."
		</p>
		<p>
			Oh, also, I'm really bad at describing myself - so bear with me here. Put simply, I like
			computers, a lot. I write funky code (primarily in C, now at least), and I enjoy administrating
			a good system. By "good," I mean anything that isn't running Windows.
		</p>
		<p>
			I strongly encourage people to use free (as in freedom) and open source software as opposed to
			proprietary garbageware; If I catch you using Discord without using it to persuade other people
			to stop using it, I'll make you walk the plank. Seriously, you're endangering yourself and your
			friends by using a chat client that still doesn't even support basic security features like
			end-to-end encryption in 2020. (And they never are going to support those features, because they
			know you're docile enough to continue feeding them your data and exposing yourself to all kinds
			of future perils).
		</p>
		<p>
			You'll probably find a lot of my rants on this website. I get a bit angry sometimes, but, you
			know, I balance it out by being equally happy at other times, because if I didn't do that I'd be
			dead.
		</p>
		<p>
			Oh yeah, if you couldn't tell, I've got a real sweet spot for nostalgic things. I mean, look at
			this website. It's so... simple! It's so elegant!
